Project Description

-- Our project is a web app which will help groups of surfers or individual surfers plan their surf sessions according to availability, each surfer's skill level, the weather, and ocean data at each surf spot in Santa Cruz.

-- The first step is to allow users to create profiles and groups where they can then set their availability (based on work and school schedules) for when they can surf.

-- We can then pull weather and ocean data from public API's such as https://magicseaweed.com/developer/forecast-api for wave and swell data and https://openweathermap.org/api for general wind and weather data.

-- Then we will use all this data to suggest the best times and surf spots for the group or individual.

-- Other possible features include social media aspects such as group chatting and sharing feedback about surf sessions. Also social media for each surf spot kind of like yelp.
